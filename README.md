# BlockPlacer
Places blocks to fill a larger block

This tool is a riff on the NapSack problem, specifically: "Given a list of rectangles (Blocks), is it possible to use some combination + orientation of these blocks to fill the larger rectangle?

The tool comes with a UI to select the smaller and larger blocks, and performs a DFS to find if it is possible, and optionally find all possible solutions.
